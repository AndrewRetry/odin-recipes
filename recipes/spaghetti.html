    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound dried spaghetti</li>
        <li>1 pound lean ground meat</li>
        <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup onion, chopped</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
        <li>/2tsp oregano</li>
        <li>a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 cup water/broth</li>
        <li>28 oz(1 can) crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>A handful fresh basil</li>
        <li>parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat (we use a Dutch oven).</li>
        <li>Add the meat and cook until browned, about 8 minutes. Use a wooden spoon to break the meat into smaller crumbles as the meat cooks.</li>
        <li>Add the onions and cook, stirring every once in a while, until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the garlic, tomato paste, oregano, and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring continuously for about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Pour in the water and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any bits of meat or onion stuck to the bottom of the pot.</li>
        <li>Stir in the tomatoes, 3/4 teaspoon of salt, and a generous pinch of black pepper.</li>
        <li>Bring the sauce to a low simmer. Cook uncovered for 25 minutes. As it cooks, stir and taste the sauce a few times so you can adjust the seasoning accordingly</li>
        <li>About 15 minutes before the spaghetti sauce finishes cooking, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Then, cook the pasta according to the package directions, but check for doneness a minute or two before the suggested cooking time.</li>
        <li>Remove the sauce from the heat and stir in the basil. Toss in the cooked pasta and leave for a minute so that it absorbs some of the sauce. Toss again, and then serve with grated parmesan cheese on top.</li>
    </ol>
