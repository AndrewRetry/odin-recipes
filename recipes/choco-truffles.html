    <h4>
        <p>Chocolate truffles are a rich, creamy, and decadent French chocolate confectionary with a chocolate ganache center and a coating of chocolate, cocoa powder, coconut, or chopped nuts.</p>
    </h4>  
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Truffles</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>285g dark chocolate <em>(chocolate chips/chocolate block)</em></li>
        <li>2 tbsp (30g) unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (125ml) cream <em><strong>(full fat)</strong></em></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Coating <em>(Optional)</em></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup dessicated coconut</li>
        <li>1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1/2 cup crushed/ground peanuts</li>
        <li>1/3 cup sprinkles or similar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup icing sugar/powdered sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place chocolate, cream and butter in a microwave proof bowl. Microwave on high for 4 x 30 second bursts, stirring in between.</li>
        <li>Cover bowl with a plate and stand for 5 minutes, then stir until chocolate is melted and smooth <em>(this is a ganache!)</em></li>
        <li>Place the bowl in the refrigerator for 6 hours. <strong>Do not</strong> be tempted to shortcut it by freezing it!</li>
        <li>Put a dinner plate or tray that you will use to place the rolled truffles on in the fridge as well.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Rolling The Truffle</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place cocoa / coatings of choice in a small bowl or plate.</li>
        <li>Remove Ganache from fridge. The chocolate mixture should be firm - softer than cold butter but harder than peanut butter.</li>
        <li>Get an ice pack or bag of frozen peas from the freezer and place on the bench. Cover with a couple of paper towels. ("Freezer Pack").</li>
        <li>Scoop up a tablespoon (using tablespoon measure), then use a teaspoon to scoop the mixture out into your hands. Roll into ball then place on chilled plate. Repeat with remaining chocolate mixture, chilling hands on Freezer Pack as needed.</li>
        <li>Once all balls are rolled, roll in cocoa or Coatings of choice. Serve at room temp so the chocolate is beautifully creamy inside!</li>
    </ol>
